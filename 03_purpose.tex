\section{Purpose of the study}

The purpose of this thesis is to evaluate the predictive power of Linespots for different domains, compare its predictions to other commonly used metrics and analyze the impact Linespots can have on code review.

By doing this, researchers can classify Linespots in the landscape of bug prediction metrics and developers of prediction models can make more informed decisions whether and how to incorporate Linespots in their models.
