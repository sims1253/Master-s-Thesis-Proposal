\section{Limitations and Delimitations}

\todo{Get some inspiration from papers about metrics}
Some limits from \cite{scholz2016line} should not be a problem with this redesign but with the wider scope (especially the `talking to humans' part)\todo{Check ESE again for these} new ones will come. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item No single benchmark for bug prediction. The one I have is only for Java, and then only Eclipse \& Apache
    \item Using projects from different languages \& communities might be a threat as their bug tracker behaviour might differ and thus skew the results that way. %rto: increases generalizability
    \item All of the projects are using git, thus restricting generalizability. %rto: Sure, but in many ways an industry standard.
    
    % https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/136079/are-there-any-statistics-that-show-the-popularity-of-git-versus-svn#150791
    % https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/
    % https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work
    % those should give a strong enough argument, that git is THE THING
    \item The new implementation might have bugs too.
\end{itemize}
%rto: You've talked about other limitations\slash threats previously. Assemble them all here and attack them piece by piece.
